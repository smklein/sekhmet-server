# TODOs

... in a vague order of priority.

1) Decouple from google-calendar3 and google-fitness1 APIs.

Apparently there is an ongoing migration to https://github.com/google-apis-rs/generator , which
also seems to be kinda WIP, so maybe I can contribute something there if I ever figure out how
to write not-totally-scrappy Rust code.

2) Actually improve the testing situation. I know this is largely integration,
but ATM it's kinda a disaster.

3) Figure out what you *actually* want to do with the google fit API.

4) Figure out what you *actually* want to do with GPIOs.

5) Play with some async APIs?

6) Clean up error handling paths.

7) Make setting primary part of init process more explicitly.

8) CLI interface for calendar? Would be handy

9) Service accounts vs Oauth2 -- figure out the difference? Can we avoid that devices page
on every new permission?
